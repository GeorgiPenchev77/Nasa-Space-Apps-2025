# Knowledge Station - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025
Project for the Nasa Space Apps Challenge hackathon 2025. For this year, our team chose to work on the "Build a Space Biology Knowledge Engine" challenge.

## 🚀 Project Overview
NASA has conducted hundreds of bioscience studies from space missions, making research difficult and hard to understand. Our solution? Knowledge Station, an AI-based application to help users explore NASA’s bioscience publications easily and interactively. The platform summarizes, structures, and visualizes decades of space biology research in one click; making it possible for scientists, students, and mission planners to discover insights faster.
