# Knowledge Station - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025
Project for the Nasa Space Apps Challenge hackathon 2025. For this year, our team chose to work on the "Build a Space Biology Knowledge Engine" challenge.

## 🚀 Project Overview
NASA has conducted hundreds of bioscience studies from space missions, making research difficult and hard to understand. Our solution? **Knowledge Station**, an AI-based application to help users explore NASA’s bioscience publications easily and interactively. The platform summarizes, structures, and visualizes decades of space biology research in one click; making it possible for scientists, students, and mission planners to discover insights faster.

## 🎯 Main Goal
Build a website that uses **AI** to summarize and organize NASA’s bioscience studies, allowing users to:
- 🔍 Search for specific research or keywords  
- 🏷️ Filter studies by tags (e.g., *plants*, *muscles*, *space radiation*)  
- 👩‍🚀 Chat with an **Astronaut AI assistant** to get explanationsand recommendations
